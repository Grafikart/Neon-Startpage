# Opera Neon Start Page

This is a work in progress. The goal is to reproduce Opera Neon start page using HTML / CSS / JS

TODO : 
- Search bar
- Better positioning of bubbles
- Improve animations on hover using CSS instead of dynamics.js

Future : 
- Save bubble positions using localstorage
- Create an interface to add bubbles

## Setup the project 

```bash
yarn
npm run dev 
# npm run build
```

Then access to `localhost:3003`
